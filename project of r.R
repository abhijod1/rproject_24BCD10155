# --- Interpretation (in comments) ---

# INSIGHTS:
# 1. Quantity is typically between 70â€“100, with laptops and keyboards most frequently bought.
# 2. Cost per unit is right-skewed. Laptops are expensive, keyboards are low-cost.
# 3. Total Cost has high variance; large spikes in years with laptop purchases.
# 4. 2024 had the highest cost due to a big laptop order.
# 5. Consider bulk discounts, especially on laptops.
# 6. Regular purchases of keyboards and monitors suggest need for stock tracking and supplier negotiation.
